    <!-- Welcome screen -->

            The next few pages will each feature a canvas, a sidebar with different features you can use, and a word or phrase in the top right corner.
            You are tasked with drawing something related to the word.
            The drawings themselves do not matter and will not be seen by anyone but yourself; do not feel pressured to make them beautiful, but please draw at least <i>something</i> related to the word.
            Have fun with it, if you want!
            <br/><br/>
            There will be 2-4 rounds of 2 drawings each, and each drawing will have a different set of features in the sidebar.
            After each round, you will be asked which set of features you liked better.
            This website will record information about the sets and usage of features you receive, your choices, and the time each drawing takes; by continuing, you consent to this information being collected and used.
            <br/><br/>
            This should take around 3-10 minutes total, depending on your choices and the detail you put into your drawings.
            Ideally, it should be completed in one sitting.
            If you are interrupted, however, or the time is not accurate in some other way, there will be an option to disregard the time you took on each round.
            All in all, the time is not too important; it is just used as a measure to see how quickly you adapt to the interfaces.
            <br/><br/>
            Please do not change the size of this window.
            <br/><br/>
            Note: You will have the option to just play around n doodle at the end if you want :)
